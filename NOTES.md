The Art of Pitchcraft
---------------------
Whether you are trying to raise capital, promote your company, or promote yourself, it's essential to have an elevator pitch. You need to communicate your main message quickly, clearly, and distinctly to someone who doesn't even know you. A good pitch takes planning and practive to deliver it quickly, on the spot, and under pressure.

You have /one minute/ to say it all.

=======
You have one minute to explain yourself, your business, your goals, and your passions. Your audience knows none of these. Are you prepared? Can you present your vision smoothly, enticing them to want to know more?

Who
===
Describe Who You Are
--------------------
Keep it short. Hint: What would you most want the listener to remember about you?

What
====
Describe What You Do
--------------------
Here is where you state your value phrased as key results or impact. To organize your thoughts it may help to think of this as your tag line. Hint: this should allow the listener to understand how you or your company would add value.

Why
===
Describe Why You Are Unique
---------------------------
Now it's time to show the unique benefits that your and/or your company bring to business. Show what you do that is different or better than others.

Goal
====
Describe Your Goal
------------------
Describe your immediate goals. Goals should be concrete, defined, and realistic. Include a time frame. This is the final step and it should be readily apparent to the listener what you are asking of him or her.

Analysis
========
Analyze My Pitch
----------------
Be passionate. Listeners may be impressed by your business logic but your excitement will create an even stronger impact.

Be careful not to turn it into a memorized monologue. You shouldn't sound like you are reciting a word-for-word speech. Otherwise your audience won't feel special. You are having a conversation (albeit a targeted one), not delivering a sermon.
