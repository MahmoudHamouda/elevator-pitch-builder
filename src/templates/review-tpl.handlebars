  <p class="review-help">Be passionate. Listeners may be impressed by your business logic but your excitement will create an even stronger impact. ... Be careful not to turn it into a memorized monologue. You shouldn't sound like you are reciting a word-for-word speech. Otherwise your audience won't feel special. You are having a conversation (albeit a targeted one), not delivering a sermon.</p>
